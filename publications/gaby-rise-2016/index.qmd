abstract: Social movement scholars have considered several political and cultural
  consequences of social movements, but have paid limited attention to whether and
  how social movements shape discourse. We develop a theory of discursive eruption,
  referring to the ability of radical movements to initially ignite media coverage
  but not control the content once other actors— particularly those that can take
  advantage of journalistic norms—enter the discourse. We hold that one long-term
  outcome of radical social movements is the ability to alter discursive fields through
  mechanisms such as increasing the salience and content of movement-based issues.
  We examine the way movements shape discourse by focusing on newspaper articles about
  inequality before, during, and after the Occupy Wall Street (OWS) movement. We analyze
  changes in the salience and content of coverage as well as shifts in actor standing
  and influence. Using 7,024 articles from eight newspapers, we find that the OWS
  movement increased media attention to inequality, shifting the focus of the discourse
  toward movement-based issue areas (e.g., the middle class and minimum wage). Further,
  we find that compared to the pre-OWS period, the influence of social movement organizations
  and think tanks rose in discourse on inequality. In addition, the discourse on inequality
  became more highly politicized as a result of the Occupy movement. These findings
  highlight the importance of social movements in shaping discourse and indicate that
  social movement scholars should further consider discursive changes as a consequence
  of social movements.
