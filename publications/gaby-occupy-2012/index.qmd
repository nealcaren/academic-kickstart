abstract: What attracted so many supporters of the Occupy Wall Street movement to
  the movement’s Facebook pages? Using a database of 1500 Facebook Occupy group pages,
  we analyze the types of posts that recruit new users. In the case of the Occupy
  movement, the success of recruiting over 400,000 users to Facebook was driven by
  user-created content produced in a medium that encourages contributions and sharing
  to an existing set of dense networks of potential movement sympathizers. We find
  that the posts that are most successful at recruiting active Facebook engagement
  utilize existing forms of communication, such as sharing pictures and status updates.
  We also find that posts that use confrontational messages and messages about solidarity
  appear most often in the top posts. Our findings suggest that online social networking
  tools such as Facebook and Twitter provide a powerful tool for movements to rapidly
  spread information and reach broad audiences. In addition, we offer some analysis
  of the impact of these findings for social movements that hope to utilize Facebook.
