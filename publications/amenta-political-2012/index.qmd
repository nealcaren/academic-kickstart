abstract: We propose a political reform theory, a political and historical institutionalist
  argument that holds that shifts in political structures, partisan regimes and policy
  greatly influence movements. We appraise this argument, along with resource mobilization,
  political opportunity and media alternatives, by analyzing 600,000 articles in the
  New York Times and Washington Post that mention national U.S. social movement organizations
  (SMOs) in the largest 34 SMO industries across the twentieth century. We provide
  multivariate analyses of industry-level article mentions of SMOs and detailed analyses
  of the historical trajectories of coverage across the century. Although we find
  some support for major theories of movements and media influences, the political
  reform theory is strongly supported and outperforms standard political opportunity
  models. We conclude with suggestions to synthesize theories and for research on
  movement and media outcomes.
