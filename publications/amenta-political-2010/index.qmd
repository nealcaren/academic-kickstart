abstract: Research on the political consequences of social movements has recently
  accelerated. We take stock of this research with a focus on movements in democratic
  polities and the United States in comparative and historical perspective. Although
  most studies demonstrate the influence of the largest movements, this research has
  not addressed how much movements matter. As for the conditions under which movements
  matter, scholars have been revising their initial hypotheses that the strategies,
  organizational forms, and political contexts that aid mobilization also aid in gaining
  and exerting political influence. Scholars are exploring alternative arguments about
  the productivity of different actions and characteristics of movements and movement
  organizations in the varied political contexts and institutional settings they face.
  Researchers are also employing more innovative research designs to appraise these
  more complex arguments. Scholarship will advance best if scholars continue to think
  through the interactions between strategies, organizations, and contexts; address
  movement influences on processes in institutional politics beyond the agenda-setting
  stage; situate case studies in comparative and historical perspective; and make
  more comparisons across movements and issues.
