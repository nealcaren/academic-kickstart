abstract: In this article we review theory and comparative and historical research
  on US social policy. We discuss first the conceptual frameworks used to think about
  social policy, the changing images of American social policy implied by these different
  frameworks, and the questions they raise. From there we examine the arguments offered
  to answer questions about US social policy as well as the research strategies and
  evidence used to appraise the arguments. We address work that situates US social
  policy in comparative perspective as well as work that examines the development
  of American social policy historically or across states. Although many lines of
  argumentation have some empirical support, we find that some lines of political
  and institutional analyses provide the best supported answers to the questions and
  the greatest potential for wide usage in comparative and historical studies. We
  conclude that scholars would do well not to treat American social policy as so exceptional
  as to require separate images, explanations, and approaches. We suggest promising
  new lines of empirical inquiry prompted by new conceptualizations of social policy
  and other developments in this literature.
