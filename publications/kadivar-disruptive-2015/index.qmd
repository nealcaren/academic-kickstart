abstract: Does contentious collective action matter? Whereas most social movement
  literature has addressed this question in the US context for policy change outcomes,
  this paper takes a different approach by bringing the question to a global context
  and examines democratization as a structural outcome. Accordingly, we test several
  hypotheses about the ephemeral, positive, and negative influences of contentious
  collective action on the democratization process in a given country, as well as
  the cross-border effect of the contention. To go beyond the limitations of previous
  studies, this paper uses a monthly time-series, cross-national model to examine
  potential liberalizing or deliberalizing effects of protest activities. Using data
  from 103 non-democratic countries from 1990 to 2004, we find that protests and riots
  increase the probability that a country will liberalize in a given month. We find
  that while contentious events in other countries do not directly increase the risk
  of liberalization, external contentious events, especially those that lead to political
  liberalization, increase the count of contentious events, thus indirectly boosting
  liberalization. We find no evidence that protest significantly increases the chances
  of deliberalization. Together, our findings show a key role for non-elite political
  actors to influence political liberalization.
