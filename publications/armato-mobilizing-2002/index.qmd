abstract: We apply a set of rules for theorizing developed to expand the “rigorous”
  methodology of quantitative research to Doug McAdam's Political Process and the
  Development of Black Insurgency, 1930–1970 (1982). We contend that the strength
  and breadth of McAdam's data and his application of that data to refute extant theories
  combined with his new flexible—perhaps overly so—concepts allowed political process
  theory (PPT) to rise to prominence in the field. We find his book to be a good example
  of how a single-case study, despite its shortcomings, can play a crucial role in
  the development of theory and the emergence of influential research paradigms.
