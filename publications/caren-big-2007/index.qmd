abstract: This article seeks to describe and explain variation in voter turnout in
  American big city municipal elections using data from 332 mayoral elections in 38
  large U.S. cities over 25 years. In my cross‐sectional time‐series analysis of turnout
  in mayoral elections, I find that city‐level demographic factors are only weakly
  correlated with turnout. By contrast, institutional and campaign factors explain
  much of the variation. The effect of Progressive era reforms on depressing turnout
  is greatest in the most competitive elections. I conclude by discussing the implication
  of the overall downward trend in turnout and changes cities can make to increase
  participation.
