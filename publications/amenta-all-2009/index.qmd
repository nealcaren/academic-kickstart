abstract: 'Why did some social movement organization (SMO) families receive extensive
  media coverage? In this article, we elaborate and appraise four core arguments in
  the literature on movements and their consequences: disruption, resource mobilization,
  political partisanship, and whether a movement benefits from an enforced policy.
  Our fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analyses (fsQCA) draw on new, unique data
  from the New York Times across the twentieth century on more than 1,200 SMOs and
  34 SMO families. At the SMO family level, coverage correlates highly with common
  measures of the size and disruptive activity of movements, with the labor and African
  American civil rights movements receiving the most coverage. Addressing why some
  movement families experienced daily coverage, fsQCA indicates that disruption, resource
  mobilization, and an enforced policy are jointly sufficient; partisanship, the standard
  form of “political opportunity,” is not part of the solution. Our results support
  the main perspectives, while also suggesting that movement scholars may need to
  reexamine their ideas of favorable political contexts.'
