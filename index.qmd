::: {.blurb}
I am a Professor in the [Department of Sociology](https://sociology.unc.edu/) at the [University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill](http://unc.edu).

My research focuses on contemporary U.S. social movements and the use of media data to understand movement processes. With Edwin Amenta, I authored *[Rough Draft of History: A Century of U.S. Social Movements in the News](https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691232775/rough-draft-of-history)* (Princeton 2022), and my work has appeared in journals including *American Sociological Review*, *Social Forces*, *Social Problems*, and the *Annual Review of Sociology*. I am also editing [a collection](https://www.dareyoufight.org) of W.E.B. Du Bois’s writings published in *The Crisis*.

I am the editor of [*Mobilization*](https://mobilizationjournal.org), the premier interdisciplinary journal specializing in social movements, protests, and other forms of contentious politics—see our [most recent issue](https://meridian.allenpress.com/mobilization/issue).

At Carolina, I serve as Director of the First Year Seminars and Launch program. I teach Introduction to Sociology (SOCI 101) and Social and Economic Justice (SOCI 274), and at the graduate level I teach computational social science, with a focus on collecting and analyzing text data using Python.

I enjoy the trails in [Carolina North Forest](https://facilities.unc.edu/operations/grounds-services/carolina-north-forest/) and am a midpack finisher [in trail races](https://ultrasignup.com/results_participant.aspx?fname=Neal&lname=Caren).
